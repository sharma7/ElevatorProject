Proposal
--------

Project Title: Project Elevate

Provide a 1 paragraph description of your project:

Our goal for this project is to simulate and build a small-scale elevator using an FPGA
and LEGO blocks. The up and down movement of the elevator will be acheived using a combination
of a motor and pulley contraption. More importantly, the motor control will be handled using an
FPGA. We plan to utilise the on-board 8SEGMENT displays to provide floor level information. We
also plan to use the on-board switches to provide input to the elevator (e.g. which floor to go to).


What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
- 3-4 Floor Elevator Structure using LEGOs
- Implement a timer, using a counter in Verilog
- Implement 8 Segment Displays for the 5 second timer, and current floor information.
- Start work on FSM logic for Elevator

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
- We'd like to have most of the project complete by the end of this lab session
- We plan to have the FSM logic of the Elevator completed
- Pulley Structure out of Legos that will attach to the motor completed
- Have motor control via Verilog/DE2 fully fully figured out

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
- We'd like have this lab for bug fixing and minor issues
- Implement additional features such as Elevator Speed Control and a smarter
  floor counter that will give the live status of the elevator position

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?
- Simplify the functionality of our elevator, for example instead of stopping at
  each floor the elevator can simply go all the way and all the way down.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board (be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure there’s enough to go around):
- We will need a motor to move the elevator up and down
- LEGO pieces to construct our elevator structure and pulley structure
- Sensors, if we'd like to implement additional elevator features.

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
- Sequential Circuits Design: We will create an FSM to simulate the behaviour of an elevator
  using the concepts in learned in class (e.g. State Diagrams/State Tables/FlipFlop Configuration)
    - Flip Flops, Registers, Latches
- RAM/Memory to store the floors the elevator must visit

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
- This project is relatively simple but brings together many of the complex concepts we've learned
  in this class, such as Sequential Circuit Design. It shows that an elevator as simple as it is, requires
  careful planning in its design. We also find the project cool because it allows us to build an actual
  elevator structure and pulley system using LEGO, and it lets us interface with motors. Us Computer Science
  students can be Engineers too!

Why did you personally choose this project?:
- We like that we can take the concepts learned in this course and apply it to a real-world application; an Elevator!
- We also feel that through practical use, tough concepts become much easier to understand.
- We like LEGOs! As fun as they are, they are quite useful in building small scale models.
- Motors are cool! The oppurtunity to work with motors is always an awesome oppurtunity.
